# Plan: Fix GitHub Actions CI

## Objective

Fix iOS build failure in GitHub Actions CI. macOS build passes, iOS build fails with simulator runtime version mismatch.

## Context

@.github/workflows/build.yml
@CLAUDE.md

**Error from CI run 20625883433:**
```
No simulator runtime version from [22E238, 22F77, 22G86, 23A8464, 23B86]
available to use with iphonesimulator SDK version <DVTBuildVersion 22C146>
```

The Xcode 16.2 on `macos-15` runner has iOS SDK 22C146 but no matching simulator runtime installed.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Install iOS simulator runtime before build
- **type**: fix
- **files**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- **action**: Add step to download/install iOS 18 simulator runtime using `xcodebuild -downloadPlatform iOS` or `xcrun simctl runtime add`
- **verify**: Push and check CI passes
- **done**: Both build-macos and build-ios jobs succeed

### Task 2: Fallback - use xcrun simctl to list and select available runtime
- **type**: fix
- **files**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- **action**: If Task 1 fails, add diagnostic step to list available simulators and adjust destination accordingly
- **verify**: CI logs show available runtimes and build succeeds
- **done**: CI green

## Verification

```bash
gh run list --repo mbarnson/buzzword_bingo --limit 1
# Should show: completed success
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] macOS build passes (already working)
- [ ] iOS build passes (currently failing)
- [ ] CI workflow completes in reasonable time (<5 minutes)

## Output

Create `09-01-SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- What fix was applied
- Any discoveries about GitHub Actions macOS runners
- Final CI run URL showing green builds
