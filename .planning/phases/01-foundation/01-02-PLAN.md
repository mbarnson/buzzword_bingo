<objective>
Create data models for Buzzword Bingo game state.

Purpose: Establish the core types that represent buzzwords, squares, cards, and the default word list.
Output: Clean Swift models with a gloriously vulgar default buzzword collection.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create BuzzwordList model with default salty phrases</name>
  <files>Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/BuzzwordList.swift</files>
  <action>
Create a BuzzwordList struct that holds an array of buzzword strings and a name. Include a static `default` property with at least 30 corporate buzzwords, including some with editorial commentary:
- "Let's double-click on that"
- "Circle back"
- "Synergy"
- "Low-hanging fruit"
- "Move the needle"
- "Per my last email" (this one's a passive-aggressive classic)
- "Bandwidth"
- "Take this offline"
- "Thought leadership" (barf)
- "Best practices"
- "Learnings" (not a fucking word)
- "Pivot"
- "Value-add"
- "Stakeholders"
- "Action items"
- "EOD"
- "Deep dive"
- "Unpack that"
- "Align on this"
- "Run it up the flagpole"
- "Boil the ocean"
- "Ducks in a row"
- "Ping me"
- "What's the ask?"
- "Net-net"
- "Hard stop"
- "Touch base"
- "Going forward"
- "Let's table this"
- "Circle the wagons"

Make BuzzwordList conform to Identifiable and Codable for future persistence.
  </action>
  <verify>BuzzwordList.default.words.count >= 30; code compiles</verify>
  <done>BuzzwordList model exists with 30+ default buzzwords</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create BingoSquare model</name>
  <files>Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/BingoSquare.swift</files>
  <action>
Create a BingoSquare struct with:
- id: UUID (for Identifiable)
- word: String (the buzzword to display)
- isMarked: Bool (whether player has tapped it)
- isFreeSpace: Bool (center square is always marked)

Conform to Identifiable. The free space should have word "FREE" or "BULLSHIT" and isMarked = true by default.
  </action>
  <verify>Code compiles; BingoSquare can be initialized with a word</verify>
  <done>BingoSquare model exists with word, marked state, and free space support</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create BingoCard model with 5x5 grid generation</name>
  <files>Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/BingoCard.swift</files>
  <action>
Create a BingoCard struct with:
- id: UUID
- squares: [BingoSquare] (25 squares, row-major order)
- playerName: String (for pass-and-play, default "Player 1")

Add a static func `generate(from list: BuzzwordList) -> BingoCard` that:
1. Shuffles the buzzword list
2. Takes first 24 words (25 squares minus free space)
3. Creates 25 BingoSquare instances
4. Places free space at index 12 (center of 5x5 grid)
5. Returns the card

Add helper computed properties:
- `rows: [[BingoSquare]]` - returns squares as 5 rows of 5
- Subscript `[row: Int, col: Int]` for easy access

Conform to Identifiable.
  </action>
  <verify>BingoCard.generate(from: .default) returns card with 25 squares; squares[12].isFreeSpace == true</verify>
  <done>BingoCard model generates randomized 5x5 grid with center free space</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] All models compile with Swift 6
- [ ] BuzzwordList.default has 30+ words
- [ ] BingoCard generates valid 5x5 grid
- [ ] Free space is at center (index 12)
- [ ] Models conform to Identifiable
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All three model files exist in Models/ directory
- Models are clean, minimal, follow Swift conventions
- Default buzzword list is appropriately salty
- Ready for grid view implementation
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
