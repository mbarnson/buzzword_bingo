<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create BingoSquareView</name>
  <files>Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoSquareView.swift</files>
  <action>
Create a BingoSquareView that displays a single square:
- Takes a BingoSquare as input
- Shows the word centered in the square
- Uses a rounded rectangle background
- Different background color for free space vs regular
- Text should scale to fit (use .minimumScaleFactor)
- Aspect ratio should be 1:1 (square)
- Add subtle border

Keep it simple - no tap handling yet (that's Phase 2).
Use platform-adaptive sizing that works on both iOS and macOS.
  </action>
  <verify>BingoSquareView(square: .init(word: "Synergy")) renders in preview</verify>
  <done>Square view displays word with proper styling</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create BingoGridView</name>
  <files>Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoGridView.swift</files>
  <action>
Create a BingoGridView that displays the 5x5 card:
- Takes a BingoCard as input
- Uses LazyVGrid with 5 fixed columns
- Renders 25 BingoSquareView instances
- Adds consistent spacing between squares
- Adds padding around the grid
- Should look like a proper bingo card

Use GridItem(.flexible()) for columns to make it responsive.
Add a "BINGO" header above the grid with each letter over a column (classic bingo style).
  </action>
  <verify>BingoGridView(card: .generate(from: .default)) shows 5x5 grid in preview</verify>
  <done>Grid view displays full 5x5 card with BINGO header</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Wire up ContentView with sample card</name>
  <files>Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift</files>
  <action>
Update ContentView to:
1. Create a sample BingoCard using BingoCard.generate(from: .default)
2. Display BingoGridView with the card
3. Add a title "Buzzword Bingo" above the grid
4. Add a snarky subtitle like "Because this meeting could've been an email"
5. Make it look decent on both iOS and macOS

Use @State for the card so it can be regenerated later.
  </action>
  <verify>App builds and ContentView shows grid with buzzwords</verify>
  <done>ContentView displays full bingo grid with title</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete bingo grid UI displaying 5x5 card with randomized buzzwords</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open the project in Xcode
    2. Run on macOS (Cmd+R) or iOS Simulator
    3. Verify: 5x5 grid displays with buzzwords
    4. Verify: BINGO header appears above columns
    5. Verify: Center square shows FREE or BULLSHIT
    6. Verify: Words are readable (not cut off)
    7. Verify: Grid looks like a proper bingo card
    8. Run again - verify words are randomized differently
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if the grid looks good, or describe issues to fix</resume-signal>
