# Phase 3 Plan 01: Game Session & Player Management

## Objective
Create a GameSession model that manages multiple players, each with their own BingoCard. Track current player and whose turn it is for pass-and-play.

## Context
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/BingoCard.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create GameSession Model
**Type:** create
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/GameSession.swift`
**Action:**
- Create @Observable GameSession class
- Properties:
  - `players: [Player]` (struct with name and card)
  - `currentPlayerIndex: Int`
  - `buzzwordList: BuzzwordList` (shared for all cards)
- Computed properties:
  - `currentPlayer: Player`
  - `allPlayersFinished: Bool`
  - `winners: [Player]` (players who have bingo)
- Methods:
  - `static func create(playerNames: [String], using list: BuzzwordList) -> GameSession`
  - `nextTurn()` - advance to next player who hasn't won
  - `markSquare(at index: Int)` - mark on current player's card

**Verify:** File compiles, no errors

### Task 2: Create Player Struct
**Type:** create
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/Player.swift`
**Action:**
- Create Player struct (Identifiable)
- Properties: `id`, `name`, `card: BingoCard`
- Computed: `hasWon: Bool` (delegates to card.hasBingo)

**Verify:** File compiles, no errors

### Task 3: Build Verification
**Type:** verify
**Action:** Run xcodebuild for both platforms
**Verify:** Both iOS and macOS builds succeed

## Verification
- [ ] GameSession.swift exists and compiles
- [ ] Player.swift exists and compiles
- [ ] Both platforms build successfully
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

## Success Criteria
- GameSession can manage 2+ players with separate cards
- Each player gets a uniquely shuffled card from the same buzzword list
- Turn tracking works (currentPlayer, nextTurn)
- Winner detection works across all players

## Output
Create `03-01-SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- Files created
- Key design decisions
- Any deviations from plan
