# Phase 3 Plan 02: Player Setup & Handoff UI

## Objective
Add player setup screen (enter names) and handoff screen between turns. Wire up ContentView to use GameSession.

## Context
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/GameSession.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Models/Player.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create PlayerSetupView
**Type:** create
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/PlayerSetupView.swift`
**Action:**
- Text field for player names (start with 2 players, allow adding more)
- "Start Game" button when at least 2 names entered
- Clean, minimal design
- Callback: `onStart: ([String]) -> Void`

**Verify:** Preview renders, can enter names

### Task 2: Create HandoffView
**Type:** create
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/HandoffView.swift`
**Action:**
- Big text: "Pass to [Player Name]"
- Snarky subtitle (e.g., "Don't peek, you cheating bastard")
- "Ready" button to reveal their card
- Callback: `onReady: () -> Void`

**Verify:** Preview renders with sample player name

### Task 3: Update ContentView for Multiplayer
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift`
**Action:**
- Add GamePhase enum: `.setup`, `.handoff`, `.playing`, `.won`
- Replace single card with GameSession
- Show PlayerSetupView in .setup phase
- Show HandoffView between turns
- Display current player name above grid
- Handle multiple winners (game ends when all have bingo or all turns exhausted)

**Verify:** Full game flow works: setup → play → handoff → play → win

### Task 4: Build & Visual Checkpoint
**Type:** verify
**Action:** Build both platforms, verify game flow
**Verify:** Complete multiplayer flow works

---

**checkpoint:human-verify**
Test the complete multiplayer flow:
1. Enter 2+ player names
2. First player sees their card, can tap squares
3. After marking, "End Turn" or similar advances
4. Handoff screen appears ("Pass to Player 2")
5. Player 2 sees their unique card
6. First to bingo wins

Type "approved" if flow works, or describe issues.

## Verification
- [ ] PlayerSetupView works with 2+ players
- [ ] HandoffView displays correctly
- [ ] Turn-based play works
- [ ] Each player has unique card
- [ ] Winner announced correctly

## Success Criteria
- Complete pass-and-play multiplayer experience
- Clean transitions between phases
- Each player's card is unique but from same buzzword list
- Snarky handoff messages match game's tone

## Output
Create `03-02-SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- Files created/modified
- Game flow decisions
- Any deviations from plan
