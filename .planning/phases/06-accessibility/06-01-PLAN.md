# Phase 6 Plan 01: VoiceOver & Dynamic Type Support

## Objective
Add VoiceOver accessibility labels and Dynamic Type scaling throughout the app.

## Context
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoSquareView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoGridView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/PlayerSetupView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/HandoffView.swift

## Tasks

### Task 1: BingoSquareView VoiceOver Support
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoSquareView.swift`
**Action:**
- Add `.accessibilityLabel()` with the buzzword text
- Add `.accessibilityHint()` describing tap action ("Double tap to mark this square")
- Add `.accessibilityValue()` indicating marked/unmarked state
- Add `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` for tap interaction
- For winning squares, announce "Part of winning bingo" in label

**Verify:** VoiceOver reads squares correctly with state

### Task 2: BingoGridView VoiceOver Navigation
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoGridView.swift`
**Action:**
- Add `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` to grid
- Add `.accessibilityLabel()` to grid container ("Bingo card, 5 by 5 grid")
- Consider grouping rows for easier navigation

**Verify:** Grid navigates logically with VoiceOver

### Task 3: Dynamic Type Support
**Type:** modify
**Files:** All view files
**Action:**
- Use `.font(.body)` or semantic font styles instead of fixed sizes where appropriate
- Add `@ScaledMetric` for custom spacing values
- Ensure text doesn't truncate at larger Dynamic Type sizes
- Test with largest accessibility sizes

**Verify:** Text scales appropriately without breaking layout

### Task 4: ContentView Accessibility
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift`
**Action:**
- Add VoiceOver announcements for game events (bingo win, turn changes)
- Use `.accessibilityAnnouncement()` for victory overlay
- Add labels to player info and score displays

**Verify:** Game state changes are announced to VoiceOver users

### Task 5: Build Verification
**Type:** verify
**Action:** Build both platforms, test with VoiceOver enabled
**Verify:** All interactive elements are accessible

Test with VoiceOver:
1. Enable VoiceOver (Cmd+F5 on Mac, triple-click home on iPhone)
2. Navigate the grid - each square should announce buzzword and state
3. Tap squares - state change should be announced
4. Win a bingo - victory should be announced
5. Test Dynamic Type at largest size - layout shouldn't break

Type "approved" if accessibility works, or describe issues.

---

## Verification
- [ ] VoiceOver reads all squares with correct state
- [ ] Grid navigation is logical
- [ ] Dynamic Type scales without breaking
- [ ] Game events are announced
- [ ] Both platforms build

## Success Criteria
- Blind users can play the game with VoiceOver
- Large text users can read all content
- No accessibility warnings in Xcode

## Output
Create `06-01-SUMMARY.md` documenting accessibility features added.
