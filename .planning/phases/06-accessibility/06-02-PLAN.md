# Phase 6 Plan 02: Reduced Motion & High Contrast Support

## Objective
Respect user preferences for reduced motion and ensure sufficient color contrast.

## Context
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoSquareView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoGridView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/HandoffView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/ContentView.swift
@Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/PlayerSetupView.swift

## Tasks

### Task 1: Reduced Motion Support - BingoSquareView
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `Buzzword Bingo/Buzzword Bingo/Views/BingoSquareView.swift`
**Action:**
- Add `@Environment(\.accessibilityReduceMotion) var reduceMotion`
- When reduceMotion is true:
  - Disable 3D tilt animation (rotation3DEffect)
  - Disable spring bounce on tap
  - Disable pulsing glow animation
  - Use instant state changes instead
- Keep visual indicators (colors, checkmarks) but without animation

**Verify:** Squares respond instantly when reduced motion is on

### Task 2: Reduced Motion Support - Other Views
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `HandoffView.swift`, `PlayerSetupView.swift`, `ContentView.swift`
**Action:**
- Add reduceMotion environment check to each
- In HandoffView: disable bouncing arrow animation
- In PlayerSetupView: disable title entrance animation
- In ContentView: disable confetti animation when reduceMotion is on
- Replace with static alternatives where appropriate

**Verify:** All animations respect reduced motion preference

### Task 3: High Contrast Mode
**Type:** modify
**Files:** All view files
**Action:**
- Add `@Environment(\.accessibilityDifferentiateWithoutColor) var differentiateWithoutColor`
- When differentiateWithoutColor is true:
  - Add borders/outlines to marked squares (not just color change)
  - Use patterns or icons in addition to color for states
  - Ensure unmarked vs marked is clear without relying solely on green
- Consider `@Environment(\.colorSchemeContrast)` for increased contrast mode

**Verify:** States are distinguishable without color

### Task 4: Color Contrast Audit
**Type:** modify
**Files:** `BingoSquareView.swift`
**Action:**
- Ensure text on green marked squares has 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum
- Ensure text on gold winning squares has 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Use darker text or add shadows if needed for readability
- Test both light and dark mode

**Verify:** All text passes WCAG AA contrast standards

### Task 5: Build & Test Verification
**Type:** verify
**Action:** Build both platforms, test with accessibility settings
**Verify:** Reduced motion and high contrast work correctly

---

**checkpoint:human-verify**
Test accessibility settings:
1. Enable Reduce Motion (Settings > Accessibility > Motion)
2. Tap squares - should change instantly without animations
3. Win bingo - no confetti, just the overlay
4. Enable Differentiate Without Color
5. Marked squares should have additional visual indicator beyond color
6. Check text contrast on colored backgrounds

Type "approved" if settings are respected, or describe issues.

---

## Verification
- [ ] Reduced motion disables all animations
- [ ] High contrast adds non-color indicators
- [ ] Text contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1)
- [ ] Dark mode works correctly
- [ ] Both platforms build

## Success Criteria
- Users with motion sensitivity can play without discomfort
- Color-blind users can distinguish square states
- All text is readable on colored backgrounds

## Output
Create `06-02-SUMMARY.md` documenting motion and contrast features.
